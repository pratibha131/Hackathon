Healthcare app
Statement :
We were told to build a Healthcare app . In which we decided to include Appointments from the top doctors and water intake remainders with delivery of medicine deliveries with the order details . 


We have first made Login page and then sign in page then Card views of the appointments , calenders , Medicines DElivery , order details etc . then after the appointments page is further connected to the Top deails of the doctors in their specializations .









Experience
This app is made using Android Studio .In which me and my teammate have contributed equally by writting codes and developing an amazing app which is our first ever experience of creating an app so this app is not an originally developed app this is clone of the app that alreeady exists . But we have made a great efforts in building up this and we could build only half of it but was a great experience .
